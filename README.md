# RealTimePoseAI-
This contains a simple real-time pose recognition system using Mediapipe for landmark detection and a custom-made CNN-LSTM sequential model for classification.This model dtects three poses,
* Both hands up
* Left hand up
* Hands crossed

# Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
* Programming Language: Python,
* Frameworks & Libraries:,
  * TensorFlow/Keras,
  * OpenCV (cv2),
  * Mediapipe ,
  * NumPy, Pandas,

# Features
1. Real time pose detection
   * Uses Mediapipe to ecxtract the facial and body landmarks.
   * Captures real-time video feed and detect these poses.
   * Processes images frame-by-frame for live pose recognition.

2. Custom datase creation
